### Reflections and Comments

* Today was about learning new concepts alone. I utilized many things that we did not learn in class.  As a result of trail and error, exploring creative code and persistance, I feel like learned much more past the foundations of the lecture. 
* Repl has been a great resource for playtesting code quickly before placing it in my VScode file.
