        <p>I'm 28 and live in Woodinville, WA.  Before this I spent time in the Marine Corps and have a college degree from the University of Washington in Law, Economics and Public Policy.  Most days I work at my part time job in calibrations.  I used to work a heavy customer service job after college but left in search for better opportunities.  That search brought me here to Code Fellows!</p>
